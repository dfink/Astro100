*Important
**Stretch goal

Rodrigo: Spectroscopy - measuring h with SNe.
  - *Email Pete on followup SNe with 48-inch
  - Get Ia lightcurves from Pete
  - Confirmed z and h match between spectra and photometry
  - Read Phliips SN paper
  - Figures: SNe light curves, d_L (m - M) vs. cz, **Omega_m vs. Omega_lambda
  
Elba: Photometry - HR diagram of VERY old clusters.
  - Determine which stars in field have known magnitudes
  - *List magnitude/colors of stars in cluster
  - Compare HR diagram of clusters to isochrones to get cluster ages
  - Bressan et al. 2012
  - Figures: HR diagram, **model an HR diagram
  
Rachel: Spectroscopy - Temperature of nebulae
  - Find temperature and abundances of nebulae
  - Model H-alpha line (?)
  - Crab Nebula paper
  - Figures: Spectra of nebulae with H-alpha fit

Evan: Spectrscopy - Galaxies
  - Classify galaxies
  - Get template spectra for known galaxy types
  - Figures: Rotation curves

Pietro: Photometry - Transits
  - Ratio of star and planet radius
  - Model transit
  -*Talk to Andrew V.
  - Figures: Lightcurve of transit
